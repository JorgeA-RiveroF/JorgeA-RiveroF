# Hi there, I'm Jorge 👋💻🤖

Control and Automation Engineer with solid foundation for understanding how systems work, and I now apply that mindset to **building software solutions**.

I deep dive into **data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and embedded systems**. My goal is to design systems that not only function but are also **efficient, secure, and scalable** in daily life.

I've had the opportunity to apply these skills in researching academic and consulting projects, and I'm excited for the next challenge. I am always looking for ways to use technology to solve real-world problems.
